### Research Methodology

```markdown
**1. Data Collection Process:**

We will utilize the TikTok Research API to collect video metadata following 
this methodology:

- **Query Frequency:** Every 2 hours (12 times daily)
- **Time Window:** Videos created within the last 24 hours
- **Sample Size:** Approximately 100 videos per query
- **Daily Collection:** ~1,200 video records per day
- **Total Dataset:** 50,000+ videos over 6-month period

**Fields Collected:**
- Video ID, title, description
- Creation timestamp
- Engagement metrics: like_count, view_count, share_count, comment_count
- Author information: username (anonymized in storage)
- Category/hashtags (if available)

**2. Data Processing & Analysis:**

- **Hot Score Calculation:**
  Score = like_count + (view_count / 10) + (share_count √ó 2) + (comment_count √ó 1.5)
  This formula weights different engagement types based on their viral significance.

- **Trend Identification:**
  - Identify videos with abnormally high engagement growth rates
  - Detect emerging topics through hashtag and description analysis
  - Track temporal patterns of viral content emergence
  - Categorize content by topic and type

- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Time-series analysis of engagement patterns
  - Correlation analysis between content features and virality
  - Predictive modeling using machine learning techniques
  - Comparative analysis across categories and time periods

**3. Data Storage & Security:**

- **Database:** PostgreSQL with encrypted connections
- **Retention:** 30-day rolling window (older data automatically purged)
- **Privacy:** User identifiers anonymized, no PII stored
- **Access Control:** Limited to authorized researchers only
- **Backup:** Regular encrypted backups for data integrity

**4. Data Usage & Compliance:**

- Strict adherence to TikTok's Terms of Service and API usage policies
- Only publicly available data collected (no private accounts)
- User privacy protected through anonymization
- No redistribution or sale of collected data
- Results aggregated for research publications
- Individual videos referenced only with permission

**5. Technical Implementation:**

- Automated crawling system with error handling and retry logic
- Rate limit compliance (well within 100 requests/day limit)
- Logging and monitoring of all API calls
- Data validation and quality checks
- Secure token management
```
